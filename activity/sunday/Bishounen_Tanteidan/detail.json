[{"title":"Bishounen Tanteidan","summary":"Mayumi Dojima, a second-year student at the exclusive Yubiwa Academy middle school, has lost somethingâ€”a star she glimpsed just once, ten long years ago. But help is on the way, in the form of the unofficial, secretive, and thoroughly mysterious Pretty Boy Detective Club! Rumored to solve problems within the school (most of which they themselves might as well created) for reasons aesthetic rather than financial, these five gorgeous boys sweep Mayumi into their world of excitement, danger, and overwhelming beauty. \n\n(Source: Vertical, edited)","genreList":["Mystery","School"],"charactersList":["Soutouin, Manabu","Fukuroi, Michiru","Sakiguchi, Nagahiro","Yubiwa, Sousaku","Ashikaga, Hyouta","Doujima, Mayumi","Fudatsuki, Rai","Rei"],"score":"N/A","popularity":"Popularity #3916","Aired":"Apr 11, 2021 to ?","Broadcast":"Sundays at 02","Licensors":"Aniplex of America","Source":"Novel","Duration":"Unknown","Ranked":"#136762","Members":"18,503"}]
