[{"title":"86","summary":"The Republic of San Magnolia.\n\nFor a long time, this country has been besieged by its neighbor, the Giadian Empire, which created a series of unmanned drones called the Legion. After years of painstaking research, the Republic finally developed autonomous drones of their own, turning the one-sided struggle into a war without casualties—or at least, that's what the government claims.\n\nIn truth, there is no such thing as a bloodless war. Beyond the fortified walls protecting the eighty-five Republic territories lies the \"nonexistent\" Eighty-Sixth Sector. The young men and women of this forsaken land are branded the Eighty-Six and, stripped of their humanity, pilot the \"unmanned\" weapons into battle...\n\nShinn directs the actions of a detachment of young Eighty-Sixers while on the battlefield. Lena is a \"handler\" who commands the detachment from the remote rear with the help of special communication.\n\nThe farewell story of the severe and sad struggle of these two begins! \n\n(Source: MU, Yen Press; edited)","genreList":["Action","Military","Sci-Fi","Drama","Mecha"],"charactersList":["Mirizé, Vladilena","Nouzen, Shinei","Sauvy, Thoma","Kukumila, Kurena","Emma, Anju","Penrose, Henrietta","Keets, Hart","Rikka, Theoto","Rin, Rekka","Tanya, Kaie"],"score":"7.95","popularity":"Popularity #1800","Aired":"Apr 11, 2021 to ?","Broadcast":"Sundays at 00","Licensors":"None found, add some","Source":"Light novel","Duration":"Unknown","Ranked":"#5982","Members":"75,220"}]
