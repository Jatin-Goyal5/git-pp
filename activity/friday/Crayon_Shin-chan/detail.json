[{"title":"Crayon Shin-chan","summary":"There is no such thing as an uneventful day in the life of kindergartener Shinnosuke \"Shin-chan\" Nohara. The five-year-old is a cut above the most troublesome, perverted, and shameless kid one can imagine. Shin-chan is almost always engaged in questionable activities such as forgetting about a friend during hide and seek, sumo wrestling for love, performing various gags including the notorious \"elephant\" in public, and flirting with college girls. The exemplary troublemaker has done it all and has no plans to stop anytime soon.\n\nCrayon Shin-chan follows the daily shenanigans of Shin-chan with his group of friends, parading around as the self-proclaimed \"Kasukabe Defense Force.\" The adults witnessing these shenanigans unfold can't help but adore Shin-chan, as he keeps them entertained while unintentionally solving their daily troubles through his mindless anticsâ€”leaving himself as the only problem they do not know what to do with.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","genreList":["Slice of Life","Comedy","Ecchi","School","Seinen"],"charactersList":["Nohara, Shinnosuke","Nohara, Hiroshi","Nohara, Misae","Nohara, Himawari","Shiro","Buriburizaemon","Gou, Goutarou","Boo-chan","Kazama, Tooru","Happiness Bunny"],"score":"7.69","popularity":"Popularity #2087","Aired":"Apr 13, 1992 to ?","Broadcast":"Fridays at 19","Licensors":"Funimation","Source":"Manga","Duration":"21 min.","Ranked":"#10572","Members":"59,704"}]
