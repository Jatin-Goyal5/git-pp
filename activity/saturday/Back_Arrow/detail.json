[{"title":"Back Arrow","summary":"The world of Lingalind is surrounded by a mystical wall with seemingly nothing beyond its confines. Worshipped as the mother of the land, the wall delivers celestial gift capsules called \"Rakuho'' to locations across the continent. Arriving once a month, the capsules contain metallic armbands that allow the wearer to transform into a mechanical being known as a \"Briheight.\" As a result, Lingalind is thrown into constant turmoil by its warring nations, all hoping to strengthen their military prowess by procuring the offerings for themselves.\n\nOne day, a Rakuho crash-lands in the countryside with an unexpected inhabitant—a mysterious black-haired man. All eyes are set on this strange newcomer, who calls himself \"Back Arrow,\" when he claims to have hailed from a place beyond the wall—a revelation that can potentially unravel Lingalind's entire dogmatic foundation.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","genreList":["Action","Fantasy","Mecha"],"charactersList":["Back Arrow","Bi, Shuu","Lean, Elsha","Ariel, Atlee","Namital, Bit","Sin, Ren","Forté, Fine","Toatsu, Bai","Howa, Tae","Zanga, Goh"],"score":"5.69","popularity":"Popularity #3374","Aired":"Jan 9, 2021 to ?","Broadcast":"Saturdays at 00","Licensors":"Funimation","Source":"Original","Duration":"23 min. per ep.","Ranked":"#92952","Members":"24,829"}]
